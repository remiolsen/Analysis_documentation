# Non-accredited bioinformatic analyses

## Introduction

This repository contains documentation for the non-accredited bioinformatic analysis pipelines run at NGI Stockholm. Although these methods are more flexible than accredited ones, the aim is to be as specific as possible. E.g., to list current software versions, sequencing platforms currently support and which reference genomes we support.
